# Hi, I’m Chris Ferdinandi.

I’m a web developer with ADHD, and I help people build the web better.

My [daily developer tips](https://gomakethings.com/articles) are read by thousands of developers. I also create [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/@gomakethings), host [a podcast](https://gomakethings.com/podcast), and do front-end development at [Nebula.tv](https://nebula.tv/).

I love pirates, puppies, and Pixar movies, and live near horse farms in rural Massachusetts.
