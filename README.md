# Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Ferdinandi.

**I help people learn vanilla JavaScript.** I believe there's a simpler, more resilient way to make things for the web.

I'm the author of the [Vanilla JS Pocket Guide](https://vanillajsguides.com) series, creator of the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) training program, and host of the [Vanilla JS Podcast](https://vanillajspodcast.com). My [developer tips newsletter](/articles) is read by thousands of developers each weekday.

I've taught developers at organizations like Chobani and the Boston Globe, and my JavaScript plugins have been used by organizations like Apple and Harvard Business&nbsp;School.

My ideas on building a simpler, faster world-wide web have been featured in *Net Magazine*. Chris Coyier, the founder of CSS-Tricks and CodePen, has described my writing as "infinitely quote-worthy."

I love pirates, puppies, and Pixar movies, and live near horse farms in rural Massachusetts.

I send out a short email each weekday with code snippets, tools, techniques, and interesting stuff from around the web.
